# Dijkstra-PathFinder
Here is the code to find the shortest path between two vertices of a directed graph using Dijkstra Algorithm

This program is using these two data structures:
1. Dynamic Graphs.
2. Dynamic Stacks.

You can run it by following these steps:

Firstly, you have to enter the number of vertices of your graph (say n).
Secondly, you have to enter the names of those vertices one by one, when you enter the vertices they will be autoamtically indexed from 0 to n-1, order of indices will be same as order of insertion of names.
Thirdly, you have to enter the number of directed edges.
Fourthly, you have to specify the vertices by index that the particular directed edge is lying between those two edges as the console will ask from you and also insert the weight on each edge, which will represent the distance between those two vertices.
Lastly, you have to enter the index of source vertex, and then the index of the destination vertex.
Finally, it will produce the shortest path between two vertices represented by name and an arrow (like A -> E -> F -> D).
